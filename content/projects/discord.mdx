This is my very first discord bot application created in flask and python using the discord API. 
The bot was hosted in replit and a keep_alive.py file was used to keep the bot alive. Via this
project I learnt how to use the external APIs and used my critical thinking skills to create a
Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
