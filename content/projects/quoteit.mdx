Most of the time is spent finding the best prices from suppliers. To make it easier for a company to send their requirements and get the prices from multiple vendors, 
we have created a web portal. When a client raises a request for a good, a vendor gets a WhatsApp notification. The link on the WhatsApp notification asks the Vendor 
to Sign in and see the Requirement Document and Post a quote. We have allowed the client to create the document and assign fields for name & quantity which the vendor
can fill. The client can see all the vendor bids easily and select one of them.
