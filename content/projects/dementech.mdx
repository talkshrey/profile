DemenTech is an all-in-one tool to aid people with Dementia and lessen the rate of cognitive
decline and brain function. Not only does it prove to be a boon for people affected by it but
it also brings the power of technology to ease the life of their near and dear ones in treating
and taking care of them. Packed with features yet subtle and minimalistic in its UI it is a
cross-platform solution that is sure to bring a significant impact in the lives of those affected
by the syndrome!

We have two branches of the project:

1. Mobile App `https://github.com/talkshrey/tsechackathon/tree/appcode`
2. Website `https://github.com/talkshrey/tsechackathon/tree/website`
